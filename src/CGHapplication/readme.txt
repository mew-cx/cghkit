This program allows you to create a  transmission hologram using just a computer, a laser-printer, and an overhead transparency.  This hologram will behave like one created using a laser and can be projected or viewed with a point source.


Full details, instructions, samples and the latest version of the program are online at:

This code has the following dependencies:
- Swing
- jdom
- BeanShell

- FTP4j was once used for batch processing but is not necessary for core functionality.  You'll probably want to comment out these calls.
